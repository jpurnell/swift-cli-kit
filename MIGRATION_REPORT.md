## Framework divergence

Content found locally that upstream does not ship. **Nothing was discarded** — it
remains in `development-guidelines.pre-v2/`. Each item is an upstream candidate.

### Local-only rules
_none_

### Locally modified rules
Content upstream has never held — genuine local edits.

_none_

### Stale rules (no action needed)
Older upstream releases, superseded by the framework just installed. Listed for

## Next steps

1. Review `project/` and commit it to this repository.
2. Upstream anything listed above that belongs in the framework.
3. Only then remove `development-guidelines.pre-v2/`.
4. The `project-state/*` branch on the development-guidelines remote may be
   deleted only after this repository's commit is pushed.
